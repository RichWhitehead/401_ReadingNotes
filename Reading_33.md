To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.
A framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.
