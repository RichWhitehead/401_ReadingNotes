# Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

Singly linked lists are the simplest type of linked list, based solely on the fact that they only go in one direction.

Doubly linked list are two references contained within each node: a reference to the next node, as well as the previous node. 

A circular linked list is a sequence of elements in which every element has a link to its next element in the sequence and the last element has a link to the first element. That means circular linked list is similar to the single linked list except that the last node points to the first node in the list.


Big O â€“ evaluates the performance of an algorithm. One of the important things to consider w/ Big O is the time it requires at runtime and how much memory is needed (time and space).
