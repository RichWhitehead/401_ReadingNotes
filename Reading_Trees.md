Reading9a: Trees

# What is a Binary Tree 

A binary tree is a data structure in which every node or vertex has at most two children. In Python, a binary tree can be represented in different ways with different data structures(dictionary, list) and class representation for a node. However, binary tree library helps to directly implement a binary tree. It also supports heap and binary search tree(BST). This module does not come pre-installed with Pythonâ€™s standard utility module.

# Common Terminology 

- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
- Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
- Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
- Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
- Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from   the root to the bottommost node.

# Traversals

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

Depth First
Breadth First
Depth First
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

`Pre-order: root >> left >> right`
`In-order: left >> root >> right`
`Post-order: left >> right >> root`
