## What Is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of gathering information from the Internet. Even copy-pasting the lyrics of your favorite song is a form of web scraping! However, the words “web scraping” usually refer to a process that involves automation. Some websites don’t like it when automatic scrapers gather their data, while others don’t mind.

## Challenges of Web Scraping


One challenge is variety. Every website is different. While you’ll encounter general structures that tend to repeat themselves, each website is unique and will need its own personal treatment if you want to extract the information that’s relevant to you.

Another challenge is durability. Websites constantly change. Say you’ve built a shiny new web scraper that automatically cherry-picks precisely what you want from your resource of interest. The first time you run your script, it works flawlessly. But when you run the same script only a short while later, you run into a discouraging and lengthy stack of tracebacks!

However, keep in mind that because the internet is dynamic, the scrapers you’ll build will probably require constant maintenance. You can set up continuous integration to run scraping tests periodically to ensure that your main script doesn’t break without your knowledge.
