Risk analysis is the second step of risk management. In risk analysis you study the risks identified is the identification phase and assign the level of risk to each item. You first need to categorize the risks and then need to determine the level of risk by specifying likelihood and impact of the risk.

# Why use Risk Analysis

After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.
