# Reading 18: Cryptography

## What does Cipher mean?

In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code.

## What is a Caesar cipher and how does it work?

The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The cipher illustrated here uses a left shift of three, so that (for example) each occurrence of E in the plaintext becomes B in the ciphertext.

## How do you decode a Caesar cipher?

Caesar code decryption replaces a letter another with an inverse alphabet shift : a previous letter in the alphabet. Example: Decrypt GFRGHA with a shift of 3. To decrypt G, take the alphabet and look 3 letters before : D. So G is decrypted with D. To decrypt X, loop the alphabet: before A: Z, before Z: Y, before Y: X.

## How to find the Cipher in Internet Explorer

- Launch Internet Explorer.
- Enter the URL you wish to check in the browser.
- Right-click the page or select the Page drop-down menu, and select        Properties.
- In the new window, look for the Connection section. This will describe the version of TLS or SSL used.
